            <h2>What DBay focuses on</h2>
            <p>
                At DBay, we’ve got pretty much everything you can think of. From tech to random home stuff, it’s all here.
                We wanted a place where finding things didn’t feel like a chore, so the site’s built to be simple and quick.
                You don’t have to dig around or open a bunch of tabs—just search, click, and buy.
                The catalog keeps growing every day, so whatever you’re looking for, odds are you’ll find it here.
            </p>
            <h2>About our founders</h2>
            <p>
                DBay started because our founders got tired of bouncing between sites trying to find the right thing.
                No single store seemed to have it all, and that got frustrating.
                They decided to make one built by people who knew what it felt like to waste time shopping online.
                That’s how DBay was born: an e-commerce site meant to actually have everything in one place, so no one else has to deal with that problem again.
